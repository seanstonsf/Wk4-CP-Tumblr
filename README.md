# Wk4-CP-Tumblr
Week 4 HW assignment for iOS for Designers hosted by CodePath

7 hours

I spent a little bit to much time thinking about the group project and got a little stuck this week on some of the willDidAppear things mixed with animations. 

Custom Tab Bar — Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
Compose button should modally present the compose screen. Hacked together a bit.
Optional: Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in. — Partially complete
Optional: Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.
